/**
 * Bundle the compiled gateway into a single self-contained `main.js`.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *  - The gateway is compiled with `tsc` (so NestJS decorator metadata —
 *    `design:paramtypes` — is preserved in the output).
 *  - Running the tsc output directly with `node` fails at runtime because
 *    pnpm's isolated `node_modules` layout (deps live under
 *    `apps/gateway/node_modules`) is not on the resolution path of
 *    `dist/out-tsc/...`.
 *  - Bundling with esbuild inlines every dependency (including the
 *    `@x402/*` workspace packages) into one file, eliminating module
 *    resolution entirely. `@prisma/client` (native query engine) stays
 *    external and is resolved at runtime via `NODE_PATH`.
 *
 * Usage: `node scripts/bundle-gateway.mjs` (run after the tsc build step).
